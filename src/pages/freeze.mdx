# Freeze a membership

Freezing the membership allows the member to 'take a break' and pause their membership for a short period of time, before resuming at a set point in the future. A freeze is an agreed period of absence with the most common reasons being injury, illness, secondment with work, or extended holiday. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Schedule a freeze

When viewing a member's profile, visit the Membership & Payments tab. Click **Options > Freeze** by the membership package that you wish to freeze.

<Note>
  A freeze may only be scheduled from the next billing date, for a minimum
  duration of 1 billing cycle and a maximum of 6 billing cycles. Custom freeze
  periods are not yet supported.
</Note>

Once scheduled, the freeze will be represented by new events on the membership timeline.

### Remove freeze

A scheduled freeze may be removed by using the 'Remove freeze' option.

<Note>
  When using the remove freeze option, please note that scheduled payments will
  only be restored from the next usual billing day. The member will have access
  to the club again, but the interim days until the next billing date will not
  be accounted for financially.
</Note>

### Membership minimum term

If a member has not completed their membership minimum term prior to the freeze start date, the minimum term end date will be extended by the duration of the freeze.

## During a freeze

When a freeze starts, the memberâ€™s door access will be automatically suspended for the duration of the freeze.

Any payments that were scheduled during the freeze are removed. The next payment will be scheduled on the freeze end date.

### Unfreeze payment collection

You may end a freeze early by using the unfreeze option. Scheduled payments will only resume on the next billing cycle.

<Note>
  If you unfreeze, the remainder of the current billing cycle will not be
  charged.
</Note>

## Freeze details

Basic information about a freeze may viewed by clicking one of the freeze events on the timeline.
